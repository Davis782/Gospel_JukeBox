Part 1

Come Lord Jesus Come

Please Hear my Voice and Rescue Me

Come Lord Jesus Come
I pray you won't Tarry

You make the Sun rise in the Morning

You make the Moon reflect your Light

You make the wind blow and give a breeze
that makes it a Delight

You let the Birds chirp in the Morning

You open your hands and make things right

You are my God and I just thank you 

and I hope that I am your Delight

Come Lord Jesus Come

Please Hear my Voice and Rescue Me

You open your hands and make things right

You are my God and I just thank you 

and I Hope that I am your Delight
