Lord I Believe.mp3


Lord, I know you love us. You desire life abundantly. I know your plan of salvation is all that I need. I just believe. 


Oh, Lord. 


I just believe. 


I see so many others. They are crying for your help. 


I understand their struggle. I know you have that need. I just believe. Lord, Lord, Lord. 


I just believe. 


I believe you died on the cross. And you're raised on the third day. I believe you are at the right hand of the father. 


Even this day. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. 


I see so many others. They are crying for your help. 


I understand their struggle. I know you have their need. 


I just believe. Lord, Lord, Lord. 


I just believe. 


I believe you died on the cross and you're raised on the third day. I believe you are at the right hand of the father. 


Even this day. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe.
