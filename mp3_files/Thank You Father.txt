Not by MIGHT nor BY Strength but By HIS Spirit

We shall praise him in Spirit and Truth

In Faithfulness we know that we All Hear IT

His voice crying out for his Children in their Youth

I Cry Out for Thy Mercy in the Morning

I Humble my Heart to Hear at Sunset

I Lay Down in the Peace that is made by thy Blood

With Hope that Morning Comes with a Crown

Thank you Father
Thank you Lord
Thank you Master
You are Adored

Thank you Father
Thank you Lord 
Have Mercy on Me before you bring your Sword
