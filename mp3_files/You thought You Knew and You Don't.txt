To them, the gospel was foolish, 
but to me it was the wisdom of God. AH - AH

For the word of the cross, is foolishness to them that perish by the rod. 

They thought I was losing my mind Indeed. But it was being renewed in kind. 

For the foolishness of God, is wiser than men, and the mind of Christ is our recline. 

It had my soul converted, It fixed my heart on Truth. 

For you see your calling, brethren, that has had you from your youth. 

Not many wise, mighty or noble are called. 

I thank God for the Gospel of peace. 

I continue to Rest in you, my Lord, 

For your WORD is True indeed in ME.
