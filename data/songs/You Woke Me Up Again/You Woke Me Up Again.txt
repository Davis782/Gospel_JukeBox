(Verse 1)  
You woke me up again,  

Praise in my heart, Amen.  

Kept in thy hope,  
In mercy, Messiah.  

(Chorus)  
If I may, thank you True,  
In this prayer, my Love to you.  
I rest in you, my Lord,  
Obey your word in heart's accord.  

(Verse 2)  
Each breath I take,  
Your grace awake.  
Light guides right,  
Through the night.  

(Chorus)  
If I may, thank you True,  
In this prayer, my Love to you.  
I rest in you, my Lord,  
Obey your word in heart's accord.  

(Bridge)  
Lord, my salvation,  
In you, Adoration.  
Mercy never fades,  
My heart parades.  

(Chorus)  
If I may, thank you True,  
In this prayer, my Love to you.  
I rest in you, my Lord,  
Obey your word in heart's accord.  

(Outro)  
I Love you, Lord, it's true,  
From my heart, your truth I Pursue.
